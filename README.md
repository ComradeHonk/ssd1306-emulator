# ssd1306-emulator
Library for emulating the SSD1306 OLED display in the terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> Right now tests work only on POSIX-compliant systems (Linux/macOS) as they use POSIX
replacements for HAL library functions. Windows support is planned in the future.

Inspired by STM32 library written by Aleksander Alekseev (afiskon):
